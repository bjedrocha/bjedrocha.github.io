<p>Hi, my name is Bart Jedrocha. I am a software engineer with extensive practical experience in building web applications and services. Devmatic is my own little corner of the web.</p>

<h2>Want to know more?</h2>

<p>I hold a Bachelor's Degree in Software Engineering from McMaster University and a Diploma in Computer Engineering from Humber College. I have worked in the Web Industry for the past 7 years, building a wide range of scalable, real-world web applications using modern technologies like Ruby on Rails, Node.js, and Backbone.js. When not hacking behind a computer screen, I love spending my time outdoors running, biking, or canoeing. I currently live and work in Hamilton, Ontario.</p>

<h2>Why Devmatic?</h2>

<p>I created Devmatic to help represent the professional aspect of my life. I hope to use this space to document my adventures in software as well as to highlight some of my projects.</p>
